# Bonus: Report Card
#
# To complete this problem, generate and print a "report card"
# for the specified student. The report card should be comprised of
# multiple subjects, and each subject should list all exams in it
#
# To determine the subjects, use the first word in any exam's name.
# For example, "Math Test 1" is from the subject "Math"
#
# The report card should have the following header, with one empty newline below it:
# **Report Card for Alice Johnson**
#
# Each subject should look like this, with one empty newline below it:
# [Math]
#   Assignment Name      Grade    Feedback
#   Math Test 1          88       Strong understanding of concepts.
#
# NOTE: There are two spaces before each assignment name, and the table header.
# NOTE: Each column should have the following widths, with one space between each:
#         Assignment Name: 20
#         Grade: 8
#         Feedback: variable
#
# HINT: To pad a string and left-align it, use f-strings:
# `f"{var:<10}` prints the contents of `var`, pads the output with spaces to 10 characters,
#             and left-aligns the ouput
